## Overview
This project implements an image captioning system using a Vision Transformer (ViT) combined with GPT-2 language model. The system can automatically generate natural language descriptions of images from URLs.

## Features
- Image loading from URLs
- Automatic caption generation using state-of-the-art transformer models
- Support for both greedy and sampling-based text generation
- Real-time image display and caption output
- Built on the `nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning` pre-trained model
